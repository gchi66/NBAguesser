Guess the NBA player based on a set of statistics.
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

Guess the NBA player based on a set of season averages. The user selects a season, and the data is scraped from a third party source, and then the user must select the player who averaged that set of points, rebounds, and assists. Each day the user gets 5 guesses. If they get 3 out of 5 correct that day, they earn a little basketball emoji for a daily streak. The goal is for them to continue their daily streak for as long as possible!

Inspired by wordle and other daily guessing games as well as my love for the NBA, I created this project for several reasons: 1. To practice (and hopefully get good at) vanilla javascript, 2. To finish my CS50 final project, and 3. To share with other developers and get feedback, hopefully resulting in me improving as well.

The backend and skeleton of the website is done with Ruby on Rails and Javascript, and the frontend is simple SCSS. For simplicity and ease of access, the user's data including the daily streaks is all done with LocalStorage.
